# Advent of Code 

I decided to do this to learn new languages that I've been meaning to learn... and others that I really don't want to learn but should learn :)

## languages

Right now I feel most comfortable in C++, then probably C, then python. 

I'll be randomly selecting a language every day from the pool below:

+ C 
+ Python 
+ Go
+ Typescript 
+ Rust 
+ Java 
+ ocaml
+ PHP 

I've given them all point values based on how much I want to learn them, see the python script for how I've selected the langauges 

|day   | language   | part 1  | part 2  | notes  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1  | C++   | Y  | Y  | I forgot how much file input sucks in c++ :(  There are some really cool string algorithms though that I was about to make by hand but found out they actually exist! std::find and std::rfind.  |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
