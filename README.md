# Advent of Code 

I decided to do this to learn new languages that I've been meaning to learn... and others that I really don't want to learn but should learn :)

## languages

Right now I feel most comfortable in C++, then probably C, then python. 

I'll be randomly selecting a language every day from the pool below:

+ C 
+ Python 
+ Go
+ Typescript 
+ Rust 
+ Java 
+ ocaml
+ PHP 

I've given them all point values based on how much I want to learn them, see the python script for how I've selected the langauges 

|day   | language   | part 1  | part 2  | notes  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1  | C++   | Y  | Y  | I forgot how much file input sucks in c++ :(  There are some really cool string algorithms though that I was about to make by hand but found out they actually exist! std::find and std::rfind.  |
| 2  | Rust  | Y | Y  | Input parsing is legit half this challenge but it's a good way to learn a language. Rust seems really cool and this was my first time really writing it. Needed a lot of hand holding from the interbut ideally I can do this on my own someday TM |
| 3  | Golang  |Y| Y  | All I get is a map and vector! Nothing else! This language is trying to be a modern version of C and it kinda works... C doesn't have that much and neither does go. Compiler freaks out if you try to compare an int and int32. Wanted to use gofuncs a lot more but did not have opportunity to here   |
| 4  | Java | Y| Y  | I did a lot of java work last summer at amazon and honestly hate it a lot less now. It's a bit verbose but there's such a big ecosystem made around it that lessens the pain of having to use `new` when creating a hashmap or having a class wrapper around an `Int`. I'm always shocked at how little these languages have in the way of a standard library. Coming from c++ it's insane to me how I have to first check if an entry exists in a hashmap then if it doesn't default it. Why can't it default for me?

### Language Tier list 

After using these languages to solve these problems, here is a ranking list!!! 
| S | C++ 17 |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | C++ 11  | Golang  |   |   |
| B  | Rust | Python  |   |   |
| C  | C++ Pre 11  |   |   |   |
| D  | Java  |   |   |   |
| Scratch Tier |   |   |   |   |
